Metro Route PlannerA simple command-line application written in C++ to find the shortest distance and path between stations in a metro network. This project uses Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently calculate routes in a weighted graph representing the metro map.FeaturesList All Stations: View a complete list of all metro stations available in the network.Display Metro Map: See the direct connections and distances between stations.Shortest Distance: Calculate the shortest travel distance (in KM) between any two stations.Shortest Time: Estimate the travel time based on the shortest distance.Shortest Path: Display the exact sequence of stations to take for the quickest route.How to RunPrerequisites: You need a C++ compiler (like G++).Compile: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:g++ -o metro_app main.cpp
(Replace main.cpp with the name of your C++ source file if it's different.)Execute: Run the compiled program:./metro_app
UsageOnce the application is running, you will see a menu with a list of actions. Simply enter the number corresponding to your desired choice and follow the on-screen prompts to select your source and destination stations.
